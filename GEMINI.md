# Neovim Configuration (AstroNvim)

## Project Overview

This directory contains a Neovim configuration based on the [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) framework. AstroNvim is a feature-rich and extensible Neovim distribution that provides a solid foundation for a modern development environment. This configuration is a template that can be customized to suit individual preferences and workflows.

The configuration uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin management, which allows for efficient and flexible handling of plugins.

## Key Files and Directories

-   `init.lua`: The main entry point for the Neovim configuration. It bootstraps `lazy.nvim` and loads the rest of the configuration.
-   `lazy-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated by `lazy.nvim` to lock the versions of the installed plugins, ensuring reproducible installations.
-   `lua/`: This directory contains the core of the configuration, organized into several files and subdirectories.
    -   `lazy_setup.lua`: This file configures `lazy.nvim` and defines the sets of plugins to be loaded. It imports plugins from AstroNvim's core, the AstroCommunity collection, and the user's custom plugins.
    -   `community.lua`: This file is used to import plugins from the [AstroCommunity](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity) repository. Users can uncomment lines in this file to enable various community-maintained plugins.
    -   `polish.lua`: This file is for user-specific customizations and tweaks. It's a good place to add custom key mappings, autocommands, and other settings that don't belong in a specific plugin's configuration.
    -   `plugins/`: This directory is for user-defined plugins.
        -   `user.lua`: This is the primary file for adding and configuring custom plugins. Any plugins that are not part of AstroNvim's core or the AstroCommunity should be added here.

## Managing the Configuration

### Adding New Plugins

To add a new plugin to your configuration, you need to add it to the `lua/plugins/user.lua` file. The file returns a list of plugins, and you can add your plugin to this list. For example, to add a new plugin called `my-plugin`, you would add the following to the list:

```lua
{
  "username/my-plugin.nvim",
  -- Optional: specify dependencies, configuration, etc.
  dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
  config = function()
    require("my-plugin").setup({})
  end,
}
```

### Customizing Existing Plugins

You can customize the configuration of existing plugins by modifying their options in the `lua/plugins/user.lua` file or by adding custom setup code in the `polish.lua` file.

### General Customizations

For general customizations that are not specific to any particular plugin, you can add them to the `polish.lua` file. This includes things like setting Vim options, creating custom key mappings, and defining autocommands.

## Development Conventions

The configuration is written in Lua and follows the structure of the AstroNvim template. When adding new plugins or customizations, it's best to follow the existing patterns and conventions to maintain a clean and organized configuration.
